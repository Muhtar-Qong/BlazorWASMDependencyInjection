# BlazorWASMDependencyInjection
This project presents custom service injection in Blazor WebAssembly apps with example. 
1. Created a IUserService interface with a GetUsers() method.
2. Then, the service method has been implemented.
3. The service has been registered in the Program.cs file and added to the services collection.
4. Next, service lifetime in the Blazor apps has been explained as well.
5. Then, created a "AvailableUsers" Blazor component in order to consume the IUserService above.
5. Finally, the "AvailableUsers" component/page has been called in the side navigation bar 
of the application.
